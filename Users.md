**[JogAmp.org](http://jogamp.org/)**, set of high performance Java libraries for 3D Graphics, Multimedia and Processing:

> "... we use PNGJ for PNG texture     loading, which is AWT independent and pretty much more efficient."

From Dillan Cooke, Android Developer (TouchPOW!) :

> I was looking for a method to write PNG files on Android
> with good   compression and very controllable memory usage.
> We have been using it for a couple months now in our Android app [Just Add Text](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.touchpow.justaddtext), and it is perfect!  Much thanks!

It has been used to implement experimental-academic alternatives to standard PNG prediction, [using Neural Networks](http://prineblog.wordpress.com/2011/06/21/neural-network-as-predictor-for-image-coding-png/) ([ref](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5656960/png-encoder-add-own-filter-implementation))

Last but not least: I created this library for my own needs, it's part of a (private) software I developed for creating high quality **[stereograms](http://hjg.com.ar/st/index-en.html)**.
